# Releasing the pair. Running the project (dev server, demos, compose) is web/Makefile; this file only
# exists because a release has an ORDER that nothing in package.json enforces: three-slicer pins
# three-slicer-viewer exactly, so the viewer must reach the registry first or three-slicer@x.y.z cannot be
# installed at all, and the MIT mirror must be pushed after so it shows the code that was published.
#
#   make bump V=0.3.0        set both packages, the pin and the demo app's pins, then check the lockstep
#   make publish             preflight (clean tree on a pushed main, tests, tarball check) -> publish
#                            viewer -> publish three-slicer -> sync the mirror -> tag vX.Y.Z and push it
#   make publish DRY=1       the same with `npm publish --dry-run`, no git checks, no tag, no mirror push
