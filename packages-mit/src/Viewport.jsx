// 3D viewport + browser-only slicing (WASM, track C stage 4).
//  - Slice parameters are derived from the right-hand editor panel values (deriveKernelParams) — no duplicate form.
//  - Multiple objects (cumulative upload + merged TransformControls transforms), support/raft/bed/pattern/cooling/arc/seam.
//  - Toolpaths: stage 24 — the upstream libvgcode approach (GPU instancing, toolpath_gpu.js). The CPU geometry builder is gone.
//    Coordinates: kernel z-up -> toolpathGroup rotation.x=-90° (the shader computes in local z-up, view_matrix compensates).

// A sidebar panel can also be shown but not editable (`panels={{ printerCard: 'readonly' }}`) — the case a host
//  that presets printer/process/filament itself actually wants, and which hiding the card does not cover.
//  One inert wrapper per card, rather than a `disabled` prop threaded through five card components and every
//  input inside them. That also locks the host's OWN nodes (motionPanel, filamentPanel, processPanel) for free,
//  which is the right reading: a read-only printer card with a live motion panel inside it would be strange.
//  `inert=''` and not `inert={true}` — React only learned `inert` as a real boolean prop in 19, and the peer
//  range here starts at 18, where a boolean is dropped and the empty string is what gets through.
//  Only the sidebar panels are lockable (types/viewer.d.ts LockablePanel); elsewhere 'readonly' reads as visible.
//  Module scope on purpose: defined inside the component its function identity would change every render, which
//  React reads as a NEW component type and answers by remounting the whole subtree — measured on the layer
//  slider, whose <input type=range> was replaced mid-drag on the first onChange, killing the native drag after
//  one step. Any state-carrying child (focus, an IME composition, a drag) breaks the same way.

//  · gcode     — G-code text rendered instead of a slice result (no kernel run). See the injection effect below.
//  · sl1       — the SLA half of the same contract: an .sl1 archive rendered as a raster preview, no kernel run.
//  · files     — content imported once on mount (File or {name,data}), through the same extension dispatch as a
//                drop: models/3mf projects, .sl1 raster archives, and preset files.
//  · default*  — initial value for state this component owns; the host reads changes back through onEvent.
//  · sliceRequest — the host's Slice button: an identity CHANGE requests one slice of the current plate,
//                the mount value is inert (use_slice_request.js has the full contract).
//  · onEvent   — one channel for every value change ({type, value}), rather than a prop per value.
//  · onSliced  — the finished slice ({plate, stats, gcode, throughput}), the payload too big to belong on onEvent.
