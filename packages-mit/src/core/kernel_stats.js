// The kernel's stats reply -> the shape the viewer keeps (and the names wasm-core/test.mjs asserts).
// Pure, so it lives here rather than beside the worker that produces it: plate_actions consumes it and
// must not reach into the slicing module for a formatter.
// The kernel's stats object, reduced to what the UI reads. One place, because the per-plate path shows the same
//  card from the same fields and the two mappings had already started to drift.
//  overBedBy is measured by the kernel on the EMITTED extrusions, so it includes support, skirt, brim and the raft —
//  none of which exist yet when the viewer runs its own pre-slice bed check against the model's bounding box.
// `throughput` is the one field that does NOT come from the kernel's stats object — it is measured around the
//  call and sits beside them on the result, so it has to be handed in rather than read out of `s`.
