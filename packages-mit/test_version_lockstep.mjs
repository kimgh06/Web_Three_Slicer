// combination ever got assembled would be a user's node_modules — a pair nobody built and nobody tested.

// npm makes the failure permanent rather than embarrassing: a version number can never be reused, and
// unpublish is refused after 72 hours. So this runs before a release, not after one.
//
// The cost of lockstep is that a kernel-only release still bumps this package. That is cosmetic churn traded
// against a correctness failure, which is the right way round.
