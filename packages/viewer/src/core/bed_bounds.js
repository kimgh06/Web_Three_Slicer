// Does what stands on the plate fit inside the printable volume?
// The kernel asks the same question in pass1.cpp (prepare_model) and reports it as stats.over_bed — but only once a
// slice has finished. This answers it while the model is still being dragged, which is when it can still be acted on.
// Coordinates follow the kernel's: bed-local and centred on the origin, so the bed spans [-w/2,w/2] x [-d/2,d/2].
// ponytail: the bed is treated as its bounding rectangle, exactly as the kernel does — a circular or custom
//  printable_area is not reduced to a polygon here, because the polygon never reaches the kernel either
//  (deriveKernelParams collapses it to bed_width/bed_depth). Revisit both together, not this one alone.
