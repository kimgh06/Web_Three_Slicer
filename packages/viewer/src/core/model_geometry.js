//  three(x,y,z) -> model(x,-z,y) frame, and the plate grid the coordinates are expressed against.
//
// Only three.js MATH is used (Vector3/Matrix4), never the renderer — so this module runs under node and is
//  covered by test_merge_stl.mjs. That is the whole point of it not living in the scene's mount-once closure:
//  `buildMergedSTL` is the single owner of the kernel's facet numbering (see AGENTS.md), and a contract that
//  cannot be executed in a test is a contract nobody is checking.
//
// Callers pass PLAIN objects, not meshes: {id, name, extruder, localPos, matrixWorld, paint}. Deciding which
//  objects are in the list (visibility, selection) stays with the scene, because that is scene state.
