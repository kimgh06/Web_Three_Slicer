// The contract mirrors upstream's PartPlate::m_config (a DynamicPrintConfig holding only deviations, applied
// over the resolved preset config in BackgroundSlicingProcess::apply) and this repo's own omission rule:
// "follow the global value" is expressed by the KEY BEING ABSENT, never by a default written into the
// override. A host that wants a plate back on the global value deletes the key.
//
// Plate identity is the plate INDEX — the same contract every existing per-plate store uses
// (plateResultsRef, wipe_tower_x/y, the 3mf plater_id). Only the LAST plate is ever deletable
// (plate_actions.js deletePlate), so truncation IS the erase and no middle-of-the-list remap exists.
// If middle deletion is ever added, ownership must move with the plate content, not stay at the raw index.
