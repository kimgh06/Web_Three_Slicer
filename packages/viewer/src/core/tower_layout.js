/**
 * Will this plate actually change tools — the question the tower exists to answer.
 *
 * Loading a second filament is not it. A prime tower purges the nozzle ACROSS a tool change, so with two filaments
 * loaded and everything printing on T1 the slice never emits a `T` command and never builds a tower — but the
 * stand-in used to draw for the whole session anyway, a green box beside a model that would print without it.
 *
 * The two conditions are the ones `buildParams` raises `extruder_count` on (use_slicer.js), which is in turn what
 * the kernel gates its multi-tool path on: whole-object assignment to more than one extruder, or material paint
 * reaching extruder 2 or higher. Selector state 1 is the default tool (ENFORCER == Extruder1), so painting in
 * state 1 alone switches nothing.
 *
 * `support_filament` is deliberately not a third condition: on its own it does not raise `extruder_count`, so the
 * kernel emits no tool change for it either, and a box drawn for it would promise a tower the slice will not build.
 *
 * @param objects the object list as the component holds it (`{extruder, visible}`)
 * @param paintStateCounts painted facet count per selector state, as the paint brush reports it
