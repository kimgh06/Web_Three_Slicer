// The panels' public surface. Viewport.jsx is the only consumer — a barrel is worth it exactly here, where one
// file was importing fifteen, and NOT for core/, whose exports are pulled from every layer including the
// parse_3mf worker entry (routing that through a barrel would drag all of core/ into the worker chunk).
// Nothing inside ui/ imports this file: a folder that imports its own barrel is how import cycles start.
