// The move scrub — the horizontal counterpart of the layer slider, and upstream's sequential view
// (GCodeViewer's update_sequential_view_current) in this viewer's terms: the vertical slider picks WHICH layers
// are shown, this one picks how far into the TOP one the print has got. The top layer is cut at move `at` —
// extrusions and travels together, in emission order — and the nozzle marker goes where that move ended, with a
// ghost where the layer ends.
//
// FFF only, and that is not an omission: mSLA cures a whole layer in one exposure, so a resin layer has no
// intra-layer order for this bar to walk. An imported .sl1 briefly shows raster planes that an exposure ramp
// could have filled in, but the mask reconstruction replaces them with a solid mesh in a few hundred
// milliseconds (measured: 400ms on a 6-layer archive), so that mode would exist only for a state nobody sees.
// Upstream reaches the same conclusion — PrusaSlicer's SLA preview has a layer slider and no horizontal one.
//
// `at === null` means "the whole layer", which is the state everything is in until someone drags the bar.
