// A settings change invalidates every result on screen.
//
// Everything shown after a slice — the toolpaths, the stats card, the layer slider, the G-code export — describes
// the settings it was sliced with. Change one and the picture stops matching the panel next to it, silently: the
// preview still renders, the estimate still reads plausibly, and the Export button still hands out G-code the
// current settings would not produce. With auto-slice on, that window is the 0.8s debounce; with it off, it lasts
// until the user happens to slice again.
//
// So the result is dropped and the viewer goes back to Prepare. Auto-slice then re-slices into the empty preview,
// which is the honest sequence: the old picture is gone before the new one exists.
//
// Two kinds of plate are NOT invalidated, because neither claims to be a slice of these settings:
//  · an INJECTED plate (the `gcode` / `sl1` props) — the same guard autoSlice and sliceRequest use; it is the
//    host's content, not ours to discard.
//  · an OPENED `.sl1` archive (`stats.sla_raster`) — and this one is not merely allowed but required. The import
//    applies the archive's own settings through setSettings (plate_actions.js) and then populates the plate, so
//    invalidating on that write would erase the very result the file was opened to show.
//
// An in-flight slice is deliberately left running: it was asked for, and cancelling it would make a settings nudge
// silently discard work in progress. Its result lands under the new settings and is invalidated on the NEXT change.

// Both decisions — "did the values actually change" and "does this result survive" — live in
// core/slice_staleness.js, where they are node-testable.

  //  technology does (plate_settings.js switchTechOverrides). A plate that declares its own printer_technology
  //  states the technology it prints in and stays in place. The stash is a ref: session state of the viewer,
  //  outside the host's plateSettings contract and outside undo (which stops at plate settings anyway).
