// 3MF project WRITER — the inverse of parse_3mf.js. What upstream calls "save project as": a zip whose
//  3D/3dmodel.model holds the meshes and whose Metadata/*.config hold the preset, the per-object state and the
//  plate layout. Reading only the geometry back would lose the half of the file the user actually tuned, so all of
//  it is written — and it is written the way UPSTREAM spells it, because the point of a project file is that
//  OrcaSlicer/BambuStudio can open it.
// Three spellings that are not negotiable (each is the mirror of a trap parse_3mf.js documents):
//   · every project_settings.config value is a STRING — serializeProjectSettings does that coercion
//   · plates live in WORLD space under upstream's own grid (corner origin, gap = bed/5, rows along -y)
//   · painting rides on the <triangle> tag as paint_color / paint_supports hex, not in model_settings.config

//  total time (1.27s -> 1.53s, the price of handing the buffers across) and buys back more than twice that in
//  responsiveness — the longest frame gap drops from 1203ms to 515ms. The bigger the model the better that trade
//  gets, since the freeze grows with the deflate while the handover does not.
// The fallback is not defensive padding, for the same reason it is not there: `zip` needs the `Worker` global and
