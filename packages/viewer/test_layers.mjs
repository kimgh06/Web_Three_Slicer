// The src/ layer boundary, as a check rather than a convention.
//   Run: node packages/viewer/test_layers.mjs
//
// src/ is laid out by ONE question — "can this run under node?" — because that is the only line that was already
// real in this package: every test here covers something on the pure side of it, and nothing covers the other.
//
//   core/     no React, no DOM, no renderer. three.js MATH is fine (Matrix4/Vector3 run under node, which is why
//             scale_box and model_geometry are testable at all); WebGLRenderer and friends are not.
//   scene/    the three.js/DOM shell. Untestable here by nature — so it should stay thin.
//   actions/  use cases: they take refs + the scene's apiRef and decide what happens.
//   ui/       presentational React. Props in, markup out.
//   src/      the entry (Viewport.jsx), its own hooks, and the worker entry points the build resolves by path.
//
// Without this file the layout is decoration: nothing stops an `import * as THREE from 'three'` landing in
// bed_bounds.js, and the first one that does silently ends that file's testability.
